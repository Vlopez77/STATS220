## My Meme

My **Meme** is a meme that took inspiration from a basic 4 square format meme but expresses my feelings about the activities that I would like to have been doing instead of all the code that I have been doing recently.

## My animated GIF

I wanted to create a similar **GIF** as the breathing give in lab 2 with a count down instead of counting to 4 so I created a bomb countdown which was harder to code as I wanted to use a electric clock format of 00:05 but this proved not possible with my **current skill**, the GIF was supposed to be a slow countdown to a more of an *annoying joke*.
